[Poker Tracker](https://poker-tracker.herokuapp.com/) is a python terminal program that runs on Heroku. Poker Tracker intended to be used by recreational poker players. The intended use is to store details of poker tournaments played i.e. entrance fees, winnings and hours palyed. Once details are stored it is possible to calculate your results to date i.e. profit, return on investment and the user's hourly winrate. These are details which professional poker players will track themselves and the program makes this easy for recreational players.

## FEATURES

Here the user is offered a choice of what they would like to do. They have the option to update the database with tournament details or view their current winrate which is based on previously entered data. There is also the option to exit the program.

### Entry Fee
Should the user elect to enter tournament details they will first be asked to enter the tournament entry fee. Here they are asked to enter a whole number without any commas and an example of a correct figure is displayed. If an invalid entry is made an error message is dispalyed and the user is asked to enter fee again.

### Winnings
The user is then asked if they won anythin in this tournament. If they respond no then a commiseration message is displayed and a zero value is returned. If they respond yes then a congratulations message displays and they are asked to enter the prize they won.
